**Concrete base Layer**

The dirt beneath your concrete slab is constantly moving. The base prevents the movement of the dirt from cracking the concrete slab by providing a layer that absorbs the differential movement often found in existing soil. When a gravel base is applied, runoff washes through the gravel base keeping your slab well supported and crack free. For hard to reach areas many contractors use pea gravel as a base for poring concrete.

**Septic Tank Decommissioning**

Decommissioning is the process of making the tank inoperative. For safety purposes it is required that a decommissioned tank be filled with sand, concrete or gravel.  We provide the service of filling your unused tank with Pea Gravel through our blower service.

Before we can begin the job we need to know how many yards of material you will need.  To determine the quantity of material, divide the gallons of the tank by 202.

**202 gallons= 1 yard**

Once you know the quantity, determine how far from the road or driveway the tank is located. Our truck is capable of blowing pea gravel up to 150 feet, however, additional charges apply for distances over 200 feet.
