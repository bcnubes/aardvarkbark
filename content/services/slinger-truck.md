##### Not all Singer trucks are the same, we proudly use CAS conveyor application system slinger truck. Made in Eugene, Oregon USA our CAS Slinger trucks are fully remote controlled and can be driven while operating the conveyor slinger system. These trucks place material up to 80 feet, going long distances other equipment just couldnâ€™t get.
