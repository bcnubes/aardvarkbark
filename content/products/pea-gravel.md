**Pea gravel** is small rounded stones. Each stone is about the size of a pea, which is were it gets its name. Ranging in size from one-eighth of an inch to three-eighths of an inch in diameter, Pea gravel is contains various colors such as white, buff, gray, and brown. Pea gravel is a specialty order product not regularly stocked in our yard and is ordered on a per project basis.

**Septic Tank Decommissioning** 

Decommissioning is the process of making the tank inoperative. For safety purposes it is required that a decommissioned tank be filled with sand, concrete or gravel.  We provide the service of filling your unused tank with Pea Gravel through our blower service. 

Before we can begin the job we need to know how many yards of material you will need.  To determine the quantity of material, divide the gallons of the tank by 202. 

**202 gallons= 1 yard** 

Once you know the quantity, determine how far from the road or driveway the tank is located. Our truck is capable of blowing pea gravel up to 200 feet, however, additional charges apply for distances over 150 feet.
