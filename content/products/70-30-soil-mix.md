+++
**Blower Topsoil** is a 70/30 blend of washed sand and organic compost. This soil is good for applications where the ground is often wet or saturated with water. Blower soil mix can be used in a wide variety of applications, and is suitable for lawns, planters or hydroseeding.

This is not a traditionally 2-way or 3-way soil mix. It does not contain a high loam content and will have different compatibility properties.
