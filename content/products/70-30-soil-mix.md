**Blower Topsoil** 

**Q:** Do you blow topsoil? 

_Yes!_

We have a specially formulated mix that we can blow in. It's a mix of 70% compost and 30% sand. We call it Blower topsoil. It has been used in a variety of applications.

Does this sound like it would work on your project?

Here are some of many scenarios this product has been used successfully by customers.

* Installing rolled Sod, spreading grass seed or hydroseeding directly on top.
* Blown in raised planter boxes and gardens areas.
* Blown in the to low spots of an existing uneven lawn.
* Blown in to the flower beds to raise up and provide good growing media for plants.
* Blown in to create raised flower beds for planting.

**Q:** I have a rock wall in my yard, above it has bad soil for growing and lots of rocks, I would like to plant in it, what have you done for customers in this situation?

**_A:_** _Blow in 2-4” layer of Blower topsoil, this makes it a smooth level surface and provides a nice place for planting. Finish it off with a layer 2-3” layer of your choice of bark to keep the moisture in the ground and the weeds suppressed._

**Q:** We just bought a house the back yard is unfinished, rocky and uneven. I don’t want to wheelbarrow topsoil! What have you done for customers in the past?

**A:** _Blow in 2-4” layer of Blower topsoil, this makes it a smooth level surface to work with. Customer does some additional preparing as desired, installs Sod, spreads seed or has hydroseeded. Apply the blower soil thicker around the perimeter to create a raised bed look for planting. Finish it off with a layer 2-3” layer of your choice of bark to keep the moisture in the ground and the weeds suppressed._

_We show up with the blower truck loaded with material 2 guys to operate it, 280 ft. of hose to reach the areas. We install the material and clean up after our work with a blower pack and if needed a garden hose to rinse the house, fence, plants etc._

**Q:** How much material can you bring? 

**A:** _The blower soil is one of the heaviest products we carry and depending on the rainfall and moisture content we can carry 12-20 yards._

**Q:** Can you go through a side gate? 

**A:** _Yes, the 4” hose is flexible. It can go over / under a fence through / over a building and floats on top of water to get to an island. (We have done all of these!)_

**Q:** How thick do you apply it? 

**A:** _We have seen the best success rates in the 1-5” range of depth for lawns, 6” and more can require compacting and may settle overtime. We have done raised plater beds over 5 ft. thick for customers. Ultimately the depth is up to the customer and what best fits their situation._

**Q:** Is there a minimum number of yards that must be ordered for blower service? 

**A:** No, we have a minimum amount that we must charge that varies on factors such as your location. Some customers are in a situation where they only need 4 yards and have no other option but to blow it in. We can do these jobs that are small but must charge accordingly. Typically, the best price is given when you can get the full truck load quantity. With traffic congestion in the Puget sound, we will spend more time in traffic getting to and from your job than what it takes to do the job.

**Q:** Do I need to rake it or compact it after it's blown? 

**A:** _Sometimes, this is more on a customer choice case by case basis. Check out our Google reviews for existing customer input._

**_Disclaimer_**

Blower Soil is not a traditional type 2 or 3 way soil mix. It does not have the same compaction characteristics of a tradition high loam content soil mix. The thicker it is installed the more spongy or soft it can feel.

Our feedback from the customers is that it can be soft and spongy at first but as the roots grow, it firms up nice.
