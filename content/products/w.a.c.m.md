Woodchip Arborist Contractors Mulch

Perfect for erosion control, wooded areas, retention ponds and other construction needs. A mix of various wood products and bark remnants, WACM provides a non-decorative ground cover at an affordable price.

This WACM is a material that comes from the byproduct of your local tree service or work done by arborists or from timber harvesting. It can include any part of a tree removed by an arborist or service: Stumps, branches, leaves, blooms, and even roots.

This is natural, organic matter that has been run through a wood chipper. Usually, it is the remnants of tree service that have been broken down into arborist wood chips. Sometimes this is old trees, and sometimes itâ€™s fresh wood. It also contains portions of bark that has been screened out of the bark manufacturing process.
