**Compost** is made from 100% recycled yard waste. The recycled yard waste is ground up, mixed and piled in rows to cook in a process called [composting](sites/8rsqm-9l3desoa/#/pages/content-info-compost-md/ "compost").  After cooking/composting the material pieces are screened and processes to be 5/8‚Äù minus. This material is commonly used as a soil amendment or topdressing.
