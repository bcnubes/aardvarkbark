Short answer No. Bark is 100% natural and organic, grown in the forest with sun and rain. It is simply the protective layer on the outside of a tree.

How do we get it? It is fairly simple. The trees are grown in the forest are cut down and taken to the lumber mill to make boards and other products. Before the logs are processed by the mill, the bark is removed from the log.

At this point the bark is ground up and processed for the consumer. In most cases it seldom comes in contact with anything but the processing equipment until we install it.
