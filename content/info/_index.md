## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Q:** Can you blow bark in the rain?

  **A:** Yes! Our trucks use a dust suppression system that adds water to the material. Blowing bark in the rain is common in Washington. 
* **Q:** Can you blow soil?

  **A:** Unfortunately, no. Pure soil is too heavy for a blower truck. The closest product we can blow is a 70/30 Mix, which is 70% compost and 30% washed sand. See our products page for more information.
* **Q:** Can you blow straw?

  **A:** Our blower trucks are not able to blow straw. It is too light to properly feed through the system.
