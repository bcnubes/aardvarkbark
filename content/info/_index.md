## Frequently Asked Questions

* Q: Can you blow bark in the rain?

  A: Yes! Our trucks use a dust suppression system that adds water to the material. Blowing in the rain is common in Washington state. 
* Q: Can you blow soil?

  A: Unfortunately, no. Pure soil is too heavy for a blower truck. The closest product we can blow is a 70/30 Mix, which is 70% compost and 30% washed sand.
