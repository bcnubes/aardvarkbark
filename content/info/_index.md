## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Q:** Can you blow bark in the rain?

  **A:** Yes! Our trucks use a dust suppression system that adds water to the material. Blowing bark in the rain is common in Washington.
* **Q:** Can you blow soil?

  **A:** Unfortunately, no. Pure soil is too heavy for a blower truck. The closest product we can blow is a 70/30 Mix, which is 70% compost and 30% washed sand. See our products page for more information.
* **Q:** Can you blow straw?

  **A:** Our blower trucks are not able to blow straw. It is too light to properly feed through the system.
* **Q:** Can you blow sand?

  **A:** No. Sand is highly abrasive and causes a significant amount of wear to the truck. We are only able to use sand in small quantities combined with compost. 
* **Q:** How far can your truck reach?

  **A:** Our trucks come to each job with 280 feet of hose. Under special circumstances we can reach as far as 300 feet.
* **Q:** Will your truck be able to get to the jobsite?

  **A:** Our standard truck is 40' long, 10' wide and 14' tall. Even though you may have had other construction vehicles or dump trucks to your location we will need to confirm accessibility prior to performing the work. We typically are able to get enough information from google maps, however, we occasionally require pictures of the jobsite be sent as text messages to our email.
* **Q:** What forms of payment do you accept?

  **A:** For all new and residential customers we can accept a check at the time of service or an electronic payment (subject to a 3% fee). For billed commercial accounts, we require   one job paid in full and a completed credit application.
